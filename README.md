# Tic Tac Toe - Using React/Redux and Socket.io

**Status** Under construction

**LIVE-Example** Soon come





<h3>Objective:</h3> To create a tic tac toe simulation in react, with different game modes (multiplayer/computer oponent), adding real-time multiplayer functionality with web sockets. 
Computer opponent should use minimax algorithm aith alpha/beta pruning  .
 
</br>
<h3>Main Challenges/Learning Experience:</h3> 

**BACKEND** - setting up ob socket.io on backend, keeping track of active users and notifying all subscribed channels when changes occur. </br>

**FRONTEND** - Implementation of a variant of minimax algorithm, optimizing with alpha beta pruning
